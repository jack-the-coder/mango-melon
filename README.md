# Operation King Tut

Operation King Tut is the third version of the existing Project Mango Melon. 

## Changes from PMM:

- Use Framework7 for front end
- Use custom HttpServer (Python 3) middle-end with Mustache templating engine and Peewee database engine
- May change hosting provider to AWS or to Azure, in which case I will use a different database software.
