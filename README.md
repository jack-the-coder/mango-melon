# Operation King Tut

Operation King Tut is the third version of the existing Project Mango Melon.

## Changes from PMM:

- Use Framework7 for front-end
- Use same Flask based middle-end with Jinja2 template engine and Peewee database engine, but with quite a bit of modified code.
- May change hosting provider to AWS or to Azure, in which case I will use a different database software. However, this is not likely. I will probably use Heroku as I have.
